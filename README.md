ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m @MinMin2424

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m all about techâ€”coding, software systems, and exploring the world of IT. Iâ€™m always diving into new things to learn and grow!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Enterprise Systems as part of my Software Engineering degree at the Czech Technical University (ÄŒVUT)ðŸŽ“, and I'm diving deep into various programming languages.

ðŸ”§ Tech stack & languages I know:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- PHP
- SQL
- Java
- C/C++
- Python

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can find me in Instagram (@minmin_tranova_army).

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m a huge fan of Enhypen & BTS, and when Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably watching K-Drama, jamming to music, or drawing. Oh, and I play guitar sometimes too!

ðŸ˜Ž So that's all about me, and I'm really glad to connect with all of you.
